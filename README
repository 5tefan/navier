This project provides a sample computational science program written
using a number of languages and approaches for the sake of language
comparison.  The sample program is a slightly modified version of a
Navier-Stoke fluid dynamics code by Griebel et al.[1].

Currenty implementations include C, Fortran, and Haskell. 

2012/13 - Accelerate (Haskell) and Ypnos (Haskell) implementations in progress.
